                                <p>It’s hard to believe, but the third year of our scholarship program is drawing to a
                                    close, and when the 4th year begins in January we will be at full rollout! We made
                                    the commitment to Ipala at the start that we would add 5 scholarships each year
                                    until we reach 20 and then maintain that number. It's just a few months till that
                                    objective is met and we’ll be actively supporting 20 students (and their families
                                    too!). Our target has always been to help good students that without some help would
                                    be unlikely to find the means to go to college or other post-secondary schools.
                                    That's what we’ve done and that is what we will continue to do!
