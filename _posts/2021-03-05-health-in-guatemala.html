                                <p>AEHCA Inc. has the ability to effect the conditions in which many
                                    of the poverty stricken families have to live in. The most in
                                    need are from the Indigenous population of Guatemala. 54% of the
                                    population is considered Indigenous.
                                </p>
                                <p>According to the UNICEF data, four out of 10 children under the
                                    age of 5 suffer from poor nutrition. This issue is even worse for
                                    the indigenous population since eight out of 10 children, or
                                    double more than the average, suffer from the same problem.
                                    Health-wise problems at an early age can affect growth, both
                                    cognitively and physically. From 2010 to 2015, mortality in
                                    children under 5 was 35 deaths a year per 1,000 live births.</p>
                                <p>There are currently over 500,000 orphans in Guatemala and one
                                    child is abandoned every 4 days. Vulnerable families are
                                    especially in need of our support. Lacking support, safe work, or
                                    daycare services, many families in Guatemala struggle to provide
                                    adequate care for their children. </p>
                                <h4 class="mt-0">How does our Organization support with health needs?</h4>
                                <p>An important part of our health work is centered around improving
                                    aspects of community health. Poor health may be a factor limiting
                                    the abilities of families to access education, earn income and
                                    participate in their communities. Our Community Health Program is
                                    built on two elements: Nutrition and Shelter. The two most basic
                                    needs. </p>
                                <p>We provide food during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                                <p>We provide families with housing and efficient smokeless cookstoves
                                    in an effort to reduce the prevalence of preventable disease. </p>
                                <p>We provide support to a Seniors Center that provides health and
                                    nutritional support to the elderly, at the same time connecting
                                    them with younger members of the community. </p>
