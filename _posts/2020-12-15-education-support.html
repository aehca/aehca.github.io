                                <p>We want to support the entire educational community
                                    (students, parents, teachers, schools and local leaders)
                                    to become strong and self-sufficient. Your donation to AEHCA
                                    makes what we do possible. </p>
                                <p>We have two focus areas: 1) The Community Learning Program; and
                                    2) The Scholarship Program. The first focuses on the community’s
                                    educational needs, while the second supports the needs of the
                                    individual through need based scholarships. In this model a
                                    community benefit approach also promotes independence and internal
                                    solutions. The flexibility of the program will allow us to directly
                                    support children of all ages to succeed in their education. </p>
                                <p>From all of us at AEHCA Inc., our partners in Ipala, and on behalf
                                    of all of our students and their families, we appreciate your
                                    support! </p>
                                <h4 class="mt-0">How does our Scholarship Program work?</h4>
                                <p>Our Scholarship Program pools together funds from generous
                                    people like you to deliver support to needy students in the
                                    municipality. At the request of our partners in Ipala our
                                    first recipients will be post-secondary school students, and
                                    we are indeed excited to pioneer in this way. It might surprise
                                    you to know that a great many children in Guatemala don’t go to
                                    school beyond elementary school and many who do go to secondary
                                    school are only able to with financial aid from outside. In Ipala
                                    a great many students are now, or have been, supported by Cedar
                                    Ridge Community Church--our local/Maryland partner. Students who
                                    have finished secondary school with Cedar Ridge’s help will now be
                                    eligible for the scholarships that we--AEHCA and YOU—are funding.
                                    Our partners in Ipala will identify students that have worked diligently,
                                    stayed in school, and are in need of our help.</p>
                                <p>This program will promote the independence of the student, develop
                                    skills that benefit the community, and prepares them to be future
                                    leaders of the community.</p>
                                <p>In lieu of starting a sponsor type of scholarship program, we ask
                                    donors to support our powerful Advanced Scholarship program as an entirety.
                                    This you can do by making a monthly donation of an amount that you can sustain
                                    over the year. </p>
                                <h4 class="mt-0">How does our Community Learning Program work?</h4>
                                <p>This program works to alleviate the educational needs of the community as a whole.
                                    It seeks out partnerships with the local schools to improve delivery of quality
                                    education at all levels. With our key principles of collaboration and community
                                    focus, our program serves the needs of the community starting from an early age,
                                    providing access to education and strengthening their knowledge along the path.
                                    Then continuing to fill the needs of students at an advanced level of education,
                                    and adults who need computer skills or learning English.</p>

                                                        for our friends in Ipala . In March we received a request for
                                                        money to purchase food for 100 people in Ipala that didn’t meet

                                                        directors met and decided to divert all of our budgeted funds of
                                                        $5,000 in 2020 to providing emergency food support to Ipala.

                                    <p>Our partners in Ipala asked for $1,300 for the first round of emergency food.
                                        They identified those people in need, purchased, and delivered that emergency
                                        food relief.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In July, we received another request for the same amount to help those in
                                        hunger.

                                        We split the cost of funding these two Emergency Food Support events with the
                                        Cedar Ridge Community Church so that we would be able to prolong our support
                                        with existing funds.

                                    <p>We had a budget of $5,000 this year and are only about halfway to that goal.
                                        We are aware that Ipala may have a need for at least two and probably more
                                        requests in the future.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We still need your support to reach our goal of $5,000. Please help us by
                                        asking friends and relatives to donate. It is simple and all donations are
                                        tax exempt.
                                    </p>
