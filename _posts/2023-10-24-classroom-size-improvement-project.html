                                    completed and ready to occupy when school resumes in mid Januaryâ€“itâ€™s going to be
                                    close! The construction crew says they are committed to making it happen, and a
                                    number of community volunteers are helping speed up the process so let's assume

                                    classroom that will get built in 2024 or 2025, depending on how quick IDEC and AEHCA

                                    concrete columns to support the second floor. Materials like steel reinforcement and
                                    sand are stockpiled in preparation for constructing that part of the building.
